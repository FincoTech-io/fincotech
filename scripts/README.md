## Employee Number Format

Employee numbers are automatically generated in the format:
- **ZWE-0000001** (Zimbabwe)
- **USA-0000001** (United States)
- **GBR-0000001** (Great Britain)

The script finds the highest existing number for the country and increments it.

## Error Handling

The script handles common errors:
- Duplicate email addresses
- Duplicate phone numbers
- Duplicate tax IDs
- Invalid email formats
- Database connection issues
- Required field validation

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- Passwords are never displayed in plain text
- Database connection uses environment variables
- Input validation prevents malicious data

## Troubleshooting

### "MONGODB_URI not found"
Make sure you have a `.env.local` file with your MongoDB connection string:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fincotech
```

### "Staff member already exists"
Check if someone with the same email, phone number, or tax ID already exists in the database.

### Permission errors on Linux/Mac
Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/create-staff.js
```

## Next Steps

After creating a staff member:
1. The employee can log in at `/management/` using their Employee ID and password
2. They'll have access to the staff dashboard based on their role
3. Admin users can create additional staff members through the web interface
