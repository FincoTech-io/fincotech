- Only do the Task i set out to do. don't change files that are not associated with the task
- When implementing code, dont implement mockdata or demo data. We need Live real data and production level code
- Remeber to always implement dark and light mode when adding colors
- When doing a task we need to procceed step by step, you should auto apply your code so i can do the review, but let me cofirm before you proceed with a new task
- When Styling Only use Tailwind Css. dont make a global.css file
